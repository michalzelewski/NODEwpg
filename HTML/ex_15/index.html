                    <h1>CFL lets women down</h1>
                    <div class="paragraph_text">
                        <p>Nearly three years ago, the CFL unveiled a comprehensive, new policy on violence against women.

                                It was trumpeted as history-changing by then-commissioner Jeffrey Orridge, as well as experts in the field.
                                
                                In November 2016, that shiny, new policy would be put to the test. Here was a chance to put the game plan on paper into practice.
                                
                                Only the league dropped the ball, and it continues to bounce around today, with nobody willing to pick it up.
                                
                                That fall, Vancouver police contacted the Winnipeg Blue Bombers about an investigation involving Euclid Cummings, a defensive lineman from Atlanta in his third year in the CFL, but first with Winnipeg.
                                
                                We don’t know how much the police told the team, because the Bombers haven’t said.
                                
                                This week we learned how serious the investigation was.
                                
                                On Oct. 16, 2016, two days after the Bombers faced the Lions in Vancouver, Cummings was allegedly involved in incidents with two women.
                                
                                Winnipeg was on the bye week, so Cummings must have stayed in town.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph_text">
                        <p>Six months later, on April 21, 2017, the 6-foot-3, 300-pound Cummings was charged with two counts of sexual assault, one count of assault and another of uttering a threat to cause death or bodily harm.

                                Of course, the Bombers didn’t know that the previous November.
                                
                                “Though charges had not been laid, we immediately informed the CFL,” a team spokesman said via a brief statement earlier this week.
                                
                                Based on the league’s supposedly groundbreaking new policy, procedures would have immediately kicked into gear, pending, obviously, the results of the police investigation.
                                
                                “In the face of a report of violence against a woman perpetrated by any CFL employee, we will always take it seriously,” Orridge had said upon the policy’s unveiling. “Doing nothing will never be an option.”
                                
                                The following statement from the CFL on that day stands out.
                                
                                “We will assess the situation and future risk to the women in question,” it read. “And engage when necessary local experts who will make up violence against women response teams… made up of social workers and other professionals with extensive experience in dealing with violence against women.”
                                
                                Sounds pretty extensive, like there would be a strict follow-up to the kind of investigation Cummings was facing.
                                
                                Yet, that didn’t stop the Edmonton Eskimos from signing Cummings as a free agent during the investigation.
                                
                                With the charges laid in April, you’d think the CFL’s history-making policy would at least take action then.
                                
                                Apparently, the league wasn’t following the case at all.
                                
                                “We were unaware of the charges,” the Eskimos said in a statement this week. “And will not comment further as the matter is before the courts.”
                                
                                An entire season went by, and no action was taken by a league that vowed “doing nothing will never be an option.” A league that promised women it would lead the way on this issue let them down.
                                
                                You’d think an extensive policy on violence against women would include some screening of players before they’re signed.
                                
                                Cummings obviously wouldn’t have a criminal record based on his current charges, so a Google search – which teams actually do, as simple as it sounds – wouldn’t have turned up anything.
                                
                                But what about a “morals” or “behaviour” clause in a player contract that requires them to disclose such things to the team — wouldn’t that be a good thing in a violence-against-women policy?
                                
                                Perhaps it exists, perhaps it doesn’t.
                                
                                We don’t know, because the league wouldn’t take questions this week.
                                
                                At the very least, should teams not ask players if they are under investigation or been charged with a criminal offence? You know, the way we all get asked at the border, on occasion.
                                
                                Instead, Cummings signed his contract without a peep, cashed his weekly paycheques and performed to cheers from the crowds in Edmonton for an entire season.
                                
                                We can only wonder how his accusers felt about that.
                                
                                But this deflating ball wasn’t finished bouncing.
                                
                                Last month, Cummings once again hit the free-agent market, with the league, in close association with its “response teams,” still unaware he was accused of violence and sexual assault against two women.
                                
                                Enter the B.C. Lions, leaders in the anti-violence campaign, and whose Be More Than a Bystander program was the impetus for the CFL’s policy.
                                
                                The Lions handed Cummings a $150,000 contract for 2018, including a $70,000 up-front bonus.
                                
                                “We were given no indication by the player or his representation that these charges existed,” Lions GM Ed Hervey said in a prepared statement. “And I assure our fans, partners and supporters of the CFL across Canada, that we would not have offered him a contract had we known about this situation.”
                            </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph_text">   
                        <p>Why did nobody know?

                                Wednesday, the charges finally came to light, and the league voided Cummings’ contract.
                                
                                I don’t know if first-year commissioner Randy Ambrosie considers that a swift and effective response.
                                
                                Ambrosie, who trumpets transparency and accountability, wouldn’t return calls the last two days.
                                
                                The players union? Mum, too.
                                
                                A policy that’ll change history?
                                
                                Tell that to the women who just see it repeating.</p>
