        <p>As night falls on Hogsmeade village, “The Nighttime Lights at Hogwarts Castle” shines 
        brightly with an awe-inspiring spectacle that showcases the four houses of Hogwarts: 
        <span>Gryffindor</span>, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff and Slytherin and culminates with awesome beams of 
        lights that fan into the night sky.
        The colorful state-of-the-art light display and special effects projection is accompanied 
        by a special musical arrangement created by Academy Award-winning composer <span>John Williams</span> 
        based on his original scores composed for the film series. The musical arrangement that 
        emanates in a surround sound environment was conducted by prolific arranger William Ross 
        and recorded by the <span>London Symphony Orchestra in London</span>.</p>
