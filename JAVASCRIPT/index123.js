/*Define a students array and assign more than 6 student names
Show the second and sixth students name in uppercase
Also, show the students array length with the following format:
        The students array has 8 items
(This is a example and you should replace 8 for your students array length)*/

const students = ['nico', 'pablo', 'martyna', 'michal', 'tri', 'anton', 'harpreet'];

studentSecond = students[1];
studentSixth = students[5];

console.log(studentSecond.toUpperCase(), studentSixth.toUpperCase());
console.log(`The students array has ${students.length} items`);
